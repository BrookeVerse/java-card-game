## 🧐 About
This project was created using intellij and Java, it was created to improve my ability with Java as a programming language. 
I used classes, to abstract information from users, so that they can play the game without needed to modify anything. 

For the user, they will be given a deck of card, that will deal one card to each player. If they get matching ranks of cards, they have two seconds to write snap to win. 
If they don't, they lose. 

## 🏁 Getting Started
To start this project, I needed to make sure that I had classes for each object I knew the game would need. They would need cards, that could create a deck which is encapsulated within the CardGame class. This means that, 
that class can be reused as well as the player class for various different types of card games.

I have various methods, that can called upon to present the deck, shuffle it ready for a new game. These methods can then be used in each card game class, such as the snap game that has been made. 


## ✔️ To-Do
Functionality I will add to this project:

◉ Add another card game to be played within this project.

◉ Add more to the player class.
